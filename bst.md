# Project 3 - Binary Search Tree

## Array: [7, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 0, 9, 4, 2]

### BST steps:  
    Root: 7
    5 is smaller than 7 so it must be in the left child of the root node
    1 is smaller than 5 so it must be in the left child of node "5"
    8 is bigger than 7 so it must be in the right child of the root
    3 is bigger than 1 so it must be in the right child of node "1"
    6 is smaller than 8 so it must be in the left child of node "8"
    0 is smaller than 0 so it must be in the left child of node "1"
    9 is bigger than 8 so it must be in the right child of node "8"
    4 is bigger than 3 so it must be in the right child of node "3"
    2 is smaller than 3 so it must be in the left child of node "3"

### Resultant binary search tree:
