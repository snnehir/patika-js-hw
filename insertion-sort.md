# Proje 1 - Insertion Sort

## 1st array: [22, 27, 16, 2, 18, 6]

### Insertion sort steps:  
    1. [22, 27, 16, 2, 18, 6]
    2. [16, 22, 27, 2, 18, 6]
    3. [2, 16, 22, 27, 18, 6]
    4. [2, 16, 18, 22, 27, 6]
    5. [2, 6, 16, 18, 22, 27]
  
  
### Worst and average time complexity of insertion sort: 
    O(n^2)

### Finding 18: 
    Average case since it's in the middle
